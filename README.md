# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description

This app allows users to search for books and save ones they are interested in reading, similar to GoodReads. It uses an Apollo server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, and has been deployed through Heroku with MongoDB Atlas.

## Installation

The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. To run, click through to the Heroku deployment.

## Usage

Create an account, log in, and search for books. Save books you are interested in reading or have read and would like to keep track of. The information for your selected books will be saved to your account, and you can view your full list of saved books or remove books from your list.
